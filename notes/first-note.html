    <p>How I think
I don't have answers. What I have are observations, questions, and a willingness to sit with uncertainty. I believe that thinking clearly is more valuable than thinking confidently.

This website isn't a portfolio—it's a public notebook. A place to work through ideas and maybe find others who are wrestling with similar questions.

Where I'm headed
Honestly? I don't know yet. And I've decided that's okay.

I'm more interested in developing a clear way of seeing than in rushing toward a fixed destination. The people I admire most seem to have built their careers by following curiosity, not five-year plans.</p>
